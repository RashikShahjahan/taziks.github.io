      <h2 id="why-i-m-starting-this-blog">Why I&#39;m Starting this Blog</h2>
<p>Hey, guys. So recently, I was reading about [Max Deutsch] (<a href="https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch">https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch</a>), and he reinvigorated my interest in dotaking up some really challenging yet fun projects. Although my fare is very humble compared to Max&#39;s, I still think having a blog will help me keep myself accountable (or it would, if I learnt how to make my blog live haha). I also think this is a great way to force myself to write regularly, as well as become better acquainted with basic website development technologies. </p>
<p>The format will be as follows: every week, beginning with this week, I&#39;ll be completing a challenge. The challenges will vary in ttheir complexity and be derived from a variety of disciplines. Because I currently have a full courseload (AP Calculus BC, Chemistry, Astronomy, and French), a number of extracurricular commitments, and am preparing for standardized testing (SATs, SAT Math Level II) - not to mention self-studying C++ - the bulk of my work will take place primarily on Fridays and Saturdays. Likewise, I&#39;ll be updating my blog every Friday. The first challenge that I set myself is to clear my Goodreads to-do-list. I had &gt;100 books in my to-do list, primarily non-fiction, and a large chunk being econ/psych/history. Of these, I would remove the ones that I&#39;m not likely to want to read in the immediate future (i.e. 1 month? I seem to overhaul my (!core) priorities every month or so, so that&#39;s actually fairly realistic). Of the rest, I planned on reading reviews on websites I trust i.e. Slatestarcodex, Wikipedia Gates Notes and NYTimes Books if those don&#39;t work out. There might still be a few books that I still want to read, which I would have to finish by the end of the week.</p>
<p>I think I should also talk about what got me interested in this project in the first place. Without going into too much detail, I&#39;d been trying to read heavily for a while now. I tried to do 1 day a book last summer. Spoiler: it didn&#39;t really pan out the way I wanted it to. The reason being to boost my knowledge and creativity so that I can contribute to society in a significant and positive way. In the past couple of months, I&#39;ve been following the effective altruism community, which has been somewhat helpful in making me settle on a concrete pathway - software engineering - (at least for now). I also have this friend who spent the year after high school to self-study university cs, econ, and electrical engineering alongside other subjects to a lesser degree who is currently in university tell me that he believes he had overestimated the importance of knowledge and that it&#39;s better to have practical programming experience over theoretical or &#39;trivial&#39; knowledge. I had also been thinking along the same lines, and had decided not to pursue research as a career (at least not now) a few days ago, and this provided the impetus for me to focus more on practical experiences over being knowledgeable. From my own reading experiences, I had also noticed I only retained the key mental models or insights from books, but nothing else aside. While reading a trove of non-fiction books didn&#39;t seem very practical anymore, I realized that I could still glean important insights by reading summaries or reviews from blogs that I trust. Hence, this undertaking.</p>
<p>Okay so here&#39;s how the first day of the challenge went - I woke up, opened my Goodreads account, and then began to &#39;clean&#39; up my to-do list. Of the 80 or so books (mostly non-fiction), it turned out that I was only very interested in ~30-40 (I actually can&#39;t remember so the numbers are pretty cooked). I then began to look reviews online. It was mostly straightforward work, but some books required more time to digest than others (I&#39;m looking at you, <a href="">Surfing Uncertainty</a>, and the Blackwell Guide to <a href="">Natural Theology</a>). At the end of my session, I was left with 4 books that I was neither i) interested in reading ii) couldn&#39;t find an adequate summary for. They were mostly historical books:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Short History of Nearly Everything</li>
<li>Homo Deus (I really enjoyed Sapiens, and this seems to be of even greater gravity so really looking forward to this.)</li>
<li>The Making of the Atomic Bomb (a veritable tome, this 800-page monster scares me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to finish this. Oh wait, I don&#39;t have to worry about it because it&#39;s not available in the Toronto Public Library.)</li>
<li>The Happiness of Pursuit (which I added just today)</li>
</ul>
